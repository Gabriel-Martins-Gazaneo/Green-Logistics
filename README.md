# Green Logistics

## First Lesson

### Definition of Logistics
Logistics is the application of logic to processes, procedures, and flows within a system.

### System
A system is a collection of processes and outcomes governed by logic, rules, and norms.

The logic within a system contributes to improving its delivery capability to achieve competence.

## Green Logistics
Green logistics represents a shift from linear production (start, middle, and end) to circular production, aiming to create multiple new beginnings, without a strict end but instead embracing a continuous pursuit of resource utilization.

A working approach where logic implies circular production, without a strict endpoint, with the possibility of numerous restarts, all with the goal of maximizing resource reuse and utilization.

### Linear Production System
- Start
- Receiving
- Inventory
- Production
- Inventory
- Shipping
- End

### Circular Production
Various processes with restarts

A **process** is what yields results. A **procedure** is how it's done. A **flow** is the logical sequence of procedures to complete a process. A **system** is the set of processes governed by a rule or norm.
