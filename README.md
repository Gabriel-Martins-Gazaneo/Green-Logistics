# Green Logistics

## First Lesson

### Definition of Logistics
Logistics is the application of logic to processes, procedures, and flows within a system.

### System
A system is a collection of processes and outcomes governed by logic, rules, and norms.

The logic within a system contributes to improving its delivery capability to achieve competence.

## Green Logistics
Green logistics represents a shift from linear production (start, middle, and end) to circular production, aiming to create multiple new beginnings, without a strict end but instead embracing a continuous pursuit of resource utilization.

A working approach where logic implies circular production, without a strict endpoint, with the possibility of numerous restarts, all with the goal of maximizing resource reuse and utilization.

### Linear Production System
- Start
- Receiving
- Inventory
- Production
- Inventory
- Shipping
- End

### Circular Production
Various processes with restarts

A **process** is what yields results. A **procedure** is how it's done. A **flow** is the logical sequence of procedures to complete a process. A **system** is the set of processes governed by a rule or norm.

# Second Lesson

## Nature vs. Environment: Complementary Concepts, but Not the Same

**Nature** refers to the environment that has not yet been impacted by human intervention. However, with the advent of human intervention (industrialization), there has been an increase in production and the use of synthetic materials, contributing to pollution. Therefore, nature represents an environment with minimal human impact.

**Environment**, on the other hand, encompasses nature (natural ecosystems) but takes a broader approach, also including artificial ecosystems.

## Conservation vs. Preservation

- **Conservation**: This involves maintaining existing individuals within a population.

- **Preservation**: Preservation aims to keep individuals alive and secure for future prospects, sometimes necessitating population growth.
